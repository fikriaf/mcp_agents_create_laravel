      <p class="text-lg text-secondary mb-8">I'm a passionate web developer with a strong background in front-end technologies and UI/UX design. With 5+ years of experience, I've worked on a variety of projects ranging from small business websites to large-scale web applications.</p>
      <p class="text-lg text-secondary mb-8">My approach to development is centered around creating beautiful, functional, and user-centered digital experiences. I believe that great design should be intuitive, accessible, and enjoyable to use.</p>
      <p class="text-lg text-secondary">When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, reading, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.</p>
